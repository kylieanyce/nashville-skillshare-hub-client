# Nashville SkillShare Hub

This mobile-first application allows users to search for skill-sharing events in the Nashville area. Users can search by cost and date, bookmark events, and have full CRUD of events.

## Motivation 

As someone who believes in mutual aid as a better way to strengthen communities, I have wanted to see and use this application for years. Usually I have to search through social media accounts and sign up for email lists to find different workshops and skill-sharing events, then I have to track down where I saw them to get more details. It's a hassle. This application allows users to post their events and to bookmark events so they can easily manage different workshops and classes they would like to attend or that they are hosting. 

## Tech Stack

*Built With:*

- ReactJS

## How To Use

Clone the front and back ends down and do all the installations. Register as a new user and you can use the app as you please. 

After logging in, the user comes to the home page which lists all upcoming events. They can click on the title to get more information about the event from the details page. There they can choose to bookmark an event they are interested in. From the home page, the user can create an event and save it. They can navigate to the *__'My Events'__* view and see the events they have created. They can also navigate to the *__'Bookmarks'__* view and see the events they have bookmarked. 

The user can search events by to parameters: *cost* and *date*. By entering a number or a word into the *cost* search affordance, events will be searched accordingly. By choosing a date from the drop down calendar in the *date* affordance, events will be search for that specific date.
